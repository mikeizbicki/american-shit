## Homelessness

* People who feed the homeless are regularly harassed and arrested by police.
See for example [this story](http://www.rawstory.com/2014/11/undeterred-by-arrest-90-year-old-florida-man-gets-another-citation-for-feeding-the-homeless/).

* In many UC cities, it is de facto illegal to be homeless.
Citywide behavioral bans prohibit sleeping in public, begging in public, loitering, sitting or lying down in public spaces, food sharing, and sleeping in vehicles, among other behaviors.
Source: [MSNBC](http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/criminalization-homelessness-the-rise-us-cities), [Think Progress](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/09/22/3570021/florida-city-criminalizes-homelessness/), http://homelesshatelaws.blogspot.com/2014/11/food-sharings-shut-down-1122014-hunger.html, http://americancynic.net/log/2015/1/1/eight_outdoor_homeless_deaths_during_2014_in_boulder_co_where_it_is_illegal_to_use_a_blanket_for_warmth/

These behavioral laws are selectively enforced against the homeless or activists.
For example, [sleeping outside for an iPhone is OK, but do it in furtherance of democratic expression and you’re in trouble](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/27/occupy-democracy-london-parliament-square?CMP=twt_gu).

In Boulder Colorado it is illegal to use a blanket for warmth.

## Foreign Policy

This aide would have included:
mobile hospitals,
water treatments plants,
1500 doctors,
and 26.4 tons of medicine.

Obama then successfully demanded the journalist be imprisoned for years.

## Corporatism:

[Wall Street banks award executives millions of dollars for getting in government positions](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/120967/wall-street-pays-bankers-work-government-and-wants-it-secret)

["Wal-Mart's low wages have led to full-time employees seeking public assistance....They receive $2.66 billion in government help each year "](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-12-18/always-low-wages-wal-mart-s-other-choices)

* Every year, corporations fail to pay an estimated 40-60 billion dollars that they legally owe to low income workers across the country.
This failure to pay is known as "wage theft."
This compares to national annual losses of only 12 billion dollars to more traditional forms of theft like robbery, burglary, larceny, and auto theft.
Source: [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_theft#Incidence) has a great summary of sources, [Think Progress](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/08/12/3470106/jimmy-johns-wage-theft/) describes a specific example involving Jimmy John's sandwich shop.

* In the "Kids for Cash" scandal, two Pennsylvania judges were bribed into sentencing thousands of children to private prisons.
Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_for_cash_scandal) has a number of details and references.

* Why is marijuana illegal?
The top 5 special interest groups lobbying to keep it illegal are:
police unions,
private prison corporations,
alcohol companies,
pharmeceutical companies,
and prison guard unions.

## Whistleblowers

* [video] John Kiriakou was a CIA agent.
He believed the "enhanced interrogation" techniques used in Guantanamo Bay were actually torture, and so he released information about them to the public.
In particular, this is how the public learned about water boarding.
Kirkiakou was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison.
He maintains it was the right thing to do, and says "I would do it all again."

He files a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to get them released.
