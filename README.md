## Government surveillance

* Major technology companies repeatedly take stances against government surveillance.

    * Twitter moves data servers from the US to Iceland so they don't have to comply with US secret warrants.

* Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee often don't know about espionage programs until news outlets break the story.
For example:

    1. The Senate Intelligence Committee didn't know about the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping which began in 2001 until the NY Times reported the story in 2005.

* The US Government claims Snowden should have used "proper channels" to get abuses fixed.
But Snowden claims to have submitted written complaints to the administration that were ignored.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Military

* The United States does not participate in many international treaties on the conduct of warfare.
For example:

    * [Cluster munitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_munition) are a particularly dangerous form of weapon for civilians.
    Approximately 5% of the bomblets do not explode on impact.
    Civilians can later discover the unexploded ordinance and accidentally cause it to explode.
    The United States has not signed the [Convention on Cluster Munitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Cluster_Munitions#States_Parties),
    and used cluster munitions extensively in Afghanistan and Iraq.

    * The 1996 [Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear-Test-Ban_Treaty) would prevent countries from performing nuclear weapons tests.
    The US has signed the treaty, but congress refused to ratify it.

<!------------------------------------>

### Spending

* The US Navy is designing the SSBNX submarine designed for the sole purpose of launching nuclear missiles.
Currently the Navy is requesting 14 of these subs be built.
The estimated lifetime cost for the subs is $347 billion over the course of 40 years.
For comparison, the cost of tuition at the University of California is $53 thousand dollars for a four year bachelors degree.
The money we're spending on submarines to launch nuclear missiles could buy over 6 million free college educations.

<!------------------------------------>

### Middle and Far East

#### Iraq and Afghanistan

* As of 2015, the [Iraq Body Count](https://www.iraqbodycount.org/) has recorded more than 140,000 violent civilian deaths in Iraq as a result of the invasion.
In an initial report covering the first two years of the war, the IBC reports that US air strikes caused the largest share of civilian casualties at 37%.
Many analysts debate these numbers, saying they are either too small or too large.
Wikipedia has a [pretty good summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War) of the various body counts and their methodology.

* In 2004, the US bombed a wedding party in Mukaradeeb, Iraq.
42 civilians were killed.
Again in 2008, the US bombed a wedding party in Deh Bala, Afghanistan.
47 civilians were killed.
In both cases, the US military claims these were not wedding parties, but militant gatherings.
Independent investigations, however, have proven the US military wrong.

* In 2011, a small team of US soldiers plead guilty to killing Afghan civilians for sport.
Source: [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/23/us-soldier-admits-killing-afghans)

* In 2010, WikiLeaks released the [Afghan War Diary](https://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Afghan_War_Diary,_2004-2010), a collection of classified military operations in Afghanistan.
These reports detail a number of previously unknown civilian casualties caused by the recklessness of coalition troops and paramilitary forces.
The Pentagon criticized WikiLeaks for releasing the documents without proper redaction.
But WikiLeaks contacted the Pentagon asking for help redacting the documents and the Pentagon refused.
Wikipedia has an [excellent summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_War_documents_leak) of information learned from the leaks.

    In 2010, WikiLeaks released the [Iraq War Logs](https://wikileaks.org/irq/), a collection of classified military operations in Iraq.
    These documents describe a number of abuses by both American forces (e.g. under reporting civilian casualties, counting journalists as enemy combatants, killings by civilian contractors) and Iraqi security forces (e.g. torturing of prisoners, summary executions).
    Wikipedia has an [excellent summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War_documents_leak) of information learned from the leaks, including detailed sourcing.

    Both series of leaks were provided by [Specialist Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning), an intelligence analyst for the US Army.
    Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
    Then Assistant Secretary of State [Philip Crowley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_J._Crowley) accuses the US military of abusing Manning while in detention and is forced to resign his post.
    Wikipedia has a [detailed summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning) of Manning's case.

* The ADE651 claims to be a device for detecting explosives and drugs, but it is an obvious fraud whose design is based on a $5 gag gift.
The product brochure claims the device uses "nuclear quadropole resonance" to detect controlled substances, but the device contains no electronics and doesn't even take a battery.
Sadly, the device was sold to the Iraqi military and was heavily used in Iraq at checkpoints.
At one point, operators believed cologne was interfering with the device's operation, and so all perfume bottles had to be removed from vehicles before being searched.
The device had a list price of $40,000 per unit, and more than 5000 units were sold to Iraq.
Despite numerous arrests and proof of fraud, officials in Baghdad continue to defend the device.

#### Mistreatment of detainees

* When the United States captured Al-Queda leader [Abu Zubaydah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Zubaydah)in 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld authorized the use of "enhanced interrogation techniques" to extract information that might prevent future terrorist activity.
According the Office of Legal Council, these enhanced interrogation techniques were legal as long as they didn't occur on American soil.
Furthermore, according to the US, enhanced interrogation techniques do not constitute torture as long as the interrogator does not "have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering".
The memos authorizing these techniques are known as the [torture memos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_memos).

* In 2005, the CIA destroyed selected video tapes of the enhanced interrogations.
The stated purpose was to protect the identity of the interrogators.
The destruction did not follow proper guidelines, and was against the recommendation of White House lawyers.
In a later investigation of the CIA's interrogations, Senator Feinstein (D-CA) reported that she suspected the CIA of destroying damning evidence.
Wikipedia has a [good overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_CIA_interrogation_tapes_destruction) with links to news sources.

* In the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, it was revealed that US Army guards committed physical and sexual abuse, torture, rape, sodomy, and murder against Iraqi detainees.
There's way too much for me to write about, but the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse) provides an excellent summary of the scandal.

* A Yemeni journalist proved that the US used cluster bombs to kill 35 women and children.
Obama then successfully demanded the journalist be imprisoned for years.
Source: [The Nation](http://www.thenation.com/article/166757/why-president-obama-keeping-journalist-prison-yemen)

#### Guantanamo Bay

* John Kiriakou was a CIA agent.
He believed the "enhanced interrogation" techniques used in Guantanamo Bay were actually torture, and so he released information about them to the public.
In particular, this is how the public learned about water boarding.
Kirkiakou was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison.
He maintains it was the right thing to do, and says "I would do it all again."

### Latin America

* The United States has had a continual military presence in Latin America since the 1800s.

    * In the [Banana Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Wars) of the late 19th century, the US fought on behalf of the United Fruit corporation.

    * During the Cold War, the US supported military coups against many democratically elected regimes.
    These include:

        * the [1954 Guatemalan coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat),
        * the [1964 Brazilian coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Brazilian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat),
        * the [1973 Chilean Coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup)

    The US-sponsored dictators committed many human rights abuses.

* After Hurricane Katrina, the US government refused foreign aide from Cuba and Venezuela.
This aide would have included:
mobile hospitals,
water treatments plants,
1500 doctors,
and 26.4 tons of medicine.

* The US Army runs the [School of Americas (SOA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation) to provide Latin American military forces "anti-communist counterinsurgency training."
The SOA Watch lists 56 [notorious graduates](http://soaw.org/about-the-soawhinsec/soawhinsec-grads/notorious-grads).
These are high ranking military officers from Latin American countries who were trained at the SOA and went on to commit human rights abuses in their home country.
The official SOA response is that "that no school should be held accountable for the actions of its graduates."

* Columbia has had [major internal conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombian_conflict_%281964%E2%80%93present%29#Role_of_the_United_States) since the 1960s.
The United States sends military aide to the government to help them fight the leftist militias.
Between 2003 and 2007, US soldiers raped 54 Columbians.
They filmed the abuse and sold the films as pornography.
But due to bilateral agreements between the US and Columbia, these soldiers are immune from prosecution.

#### Double standards

* General Petraeus was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of the CIA.
He illegally leaked classified documents to Paula Broadwell (a reporter and also his girlfriend).
During a follow on investigation, he lied to the FBI, stating he "had never provided Broadwell with classified information."
His punishment was only a $40,000 fine and two years probation.
Lower level government officials receive significantly harsher punishments.

No charges are filed against the police officers.

* There are many laws designed to protect police from being prosecuted.
For example, in Maryland, when police officers are subject to disciplinary actions, they cannot be questioned about the event for 10 days after the accusation.
This gives the officers time to straighten out their stories.

## Wealth and corporatism:

* Every year, corporations fail to pay an estimated 40-60 billion dollars that they legally owe to low income workers across the country.
This failure to pay is known as "wage theft."
This compares to national annual losses of only 12 billion dollars to more traditional forms of theft like robbery, burglary, larceny, and auto theft.
Source: [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_theft#Incidence) has a great summary of sources, [Think Progress](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/08/12/3470106/jimmy-johns-wage-theft/) describes a specific example involving Jimmy John's sandwich shop.

* Law enforcement agencies are legally required to respond to certain types requests for information about their activity.
Many law enforcement agencies have become private corporations, however, in order to circumvent these requirements.

### Treatment of the homeless

* In many UC cities, it is de facto illegal to be homeless.
187 major cities have bans on:  sleeping in public, begging in public, sitting in public, lying down in public, food sharing, and sleeping in vehicles.
See for example:
[MSNBC](http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/criminalization-homelessness-the-rise-us-cities),
[Homeless State Laws blog](http://homelesshatelaws.blogspot.com/2014/11/food-sharings-shut-down-1122014-hunger.html),
[Think Progress](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/09/22/3570021/florida-city-criminalizes-homelessness/),
[American Cynic](http://americancynic.net/log/2015/1/1/eight_outdoor_homeless_deaths_during_2014_in_boulder_co_where_it_is_illegal_to_use_a_blanket_for_warmth/)

    These behavioral laws are selectively enforced against the homeless and their advocates.
    See for example, [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/27/occupy-democracy-london-parliament-square?CMP=twt_gu).

* People who feed the homeless are regularly harassed and arrested by police.
See for example:
[Raw Story](http://www.rawstory.com/2014/11/undeterred-by-arrest-90-year-old-florida-man-gets-another-citation-for-feeding-the-homeless/), [khon2](http://khon2.com/2014/11/03/90-year-old-florida-man-arrested-for-feeding-the-homeless/).

* Businesses install spikes around their storefronts to keep the homeless away.
See for example:
[twitter](https://twitter.com/aptly_engineerd/status/583888547205128192),
[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/12/tesco-spikes-remove-regent-street-homeless-protests)
