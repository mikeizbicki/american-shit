### Guantanamo Bay

* [video] John Kiriakou was a CIA agent.
He believed the "enhanced interrogation" techniques used in Guantanamo Bay were actually torture, and so he released information about them to the public.
In particular, this is how the public learned about water boarding.
Kirkiakou was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison.
He maintains it was the right thing to do, and says "I would do it all again."

## Corporatism:

* Every year, corporations fail to pay an estimated 40-60 billion dollars that they legally owe to low income workers across the country.
This failure to pay is known as "wage theft."
This compares to national annual losses of only 12 billion dollars to more traditional forms of theft like robbery, burglary, larceny, and auto theft.
Source: [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_theft#Incidence) has a great summary of sources, [Think Progress](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/08/12/3470106/jimmy-johns-wage-theft/) describes a specific example involving Jimmy John's sandwich shop.

* Law enforcement agencies are legally required to respond to certain types requests for information about their activity.
Many law enforcement agencies have become private corporations, however, in order to circumvent these requirements.

### Homeless

* People who feed the homeless are regularly harassed and arrested by police.
See for example [this story](http://www.rawstory.com/2014/11/undeterred-by-arrest-90-year-old-florida-man-gets-another-citation-for-feeding-the-homeless/).

* In many UC cities, it is de facto illegal to be homeless.
Citywide behavioral bans prohibit sleeping in public, begging in public, loitering, sitting or lying down in public spaces, food sharing, and sleeping in vehicles, among other behaviors.
Source: [MSNBC](http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/criminalization-homelessness-the-rise-us-cities), [Think Progress](http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/09/22/3570021/florida-city-criminalizes-homelessness/), http://homelesshatelaws.blogspot.com/2014/11/food-sharings-shut-down-1122014-hunger.html, http://americancynic.net/log/2015/1/1/eight_outdoor_homeless_deaths_during_2014_in_boulder_co_where_it_is_illegal_to_use_a_blanket_for_warmth/

These behavioral laws are selectively enforced against the homeless or activists.
For example, [sleeping outside for an iPhone is OK, but do it in furtherance of democratic expression and you’re in trouble](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/27/occupy-democracy-london-parliament-square?CMP=twt_gu).

In Boulder Colorado it is illegal to use a blanket for warmth.

### Double standards on punishment

* General Petraeus was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of the CIA.
He illegally leaked classified documents to Paula Broadwell (a reporter and also his girlfriend).
During a follow on investigation, he lied to the FBI, stating he "had never provided Broadwell with classified information."
His punishment was only a $40,000 fine and two years probation.
Lower level government officials receive significantly harsher punishments.

* Officer Caesar Goodson Jr lead the team of police accused of murdering Freddie Gray.
His bail was set at $350,000.
During the riots following the murder, Allen Bullock used an orange traffic cone to smash the window of a police car.

Police officer starts inappropriately frisking a woman.
A nearby male friend says he doesn't like what's happening, so starts filming with a cellphone.
The police arrest the male friend and charge him with assault.
Video evidence clearly shows the male friend was being polite and did not assault the cops.
No charges are filed against the police officers.

* There are many laws designed to protect police from being prosecuted.
For example, in Maryland, when police officers are subject to disciplinary actions, they cannot be questioned about the event for 10 days after the accusation.
This gives the officers time to straighten out their stories.

He applied the "enhanced interrogation techniques" from Guantanamo to American citizens in Chicago.
These techniques included:
shackling suspects to the walls through eyebolts for hours,
forcing suspects to endure extreme temperatures,
sleep deprivation,
and threatening family members.
Many false convictions resulted from these practices.
